# world_cup_poule

For a world cup prediction poule with friends, I want to know what the most occuring scores are and what scores are expected to yield the highest score based on data.

I hope my friends never see this;)

# Conclusions from `src/my_wc.ipynb`

* A one goal difference game is most occuring.
* 2-0 occurs quite often, but is not a strong bet since there are relatively few cases overall in which there is a 2 goal difference.
* A prediction of 1-0 has the highest expeted return, followed by 2-1 and then 1-1.

# Suggested strategy:
* If there's a larger skill difference, predict 1-0 or 2-1 to mix things up.
* If there's little skill difference, predict 1-1.

Strange looking scores that are still quite good are: 3-2, 4-3. As long as there is one goal difference.
